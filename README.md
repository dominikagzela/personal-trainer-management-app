# personal-trainer-management-app


The application is intended for a personal trainer who can easily track the progress of his clients and make changes to their training plans and caloric diet.

Each client can log in to his account, check his training target and macronutrients, general guidelines for cooperation, training plan and be able to send a report to the trainer (measurements, list of training sessions, sent pictures of the figure, additional comments). The trainer has the ability to check the list of clients, their goals, data from reports and add or update their caloric value, training plans, exercises and general tips.
